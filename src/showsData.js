An 8-year-old American boy wakes up alone in a rice paddy in a rural Chinese province with no idea how he got there. Details start to emerge when the boy, who calls himself Jacob, recalls that his hometown is Arcadia, and an Immigration agent, J. Martin Bellamy, takes him there. The home he claims as his own is occupied by a 60-year-old couple, Henry and Lucille Langston, who lost their son, Jacob, more than 30 years ago. While they look different, young Jacob recognizes them as his parents. Lucille is overjoyed at the seeming miracle of her son's reappearance. Henry is reluctant to accept that Jacob is back. Those closest to the family want answers, including Sheriff Fred Langston, whose wife Barbara drowned 30 years ago while trying to save Jacob, and Fred's daughter, Maggie, a local doctor. Pastor Tom Hale seeks a spiritual reason for what's happening in his community. When things take an even more shocking turn, Maggie's life-long friend, Elaine Richards, finds herself drawn into Arcadia's growing mystery.

Whether they came in peace or with more sinister intentions didn't matter: a fierce battle erupted as humans fought for control over their new rivals, an alien species called the Atrians. In the midst of the conflict, Roman, a 6-year-old Atrian boy, found his way to a shed behind Emery's house, where she protected him from harm, bringing him food, comfort - and friendship. In their brief time together, Emery and Roman forged a deep bond, but the authorities wasted no time tracking Roman down and capturing him in a violent confrontation. Emery has grown up believing that Roman was killed that day. Ten years later, the Atrians have been acclimated to life on Earth, but they are interned in a heavily-guarded camp known as the Sector to keep them separate from humans. Now, for the first time, a group of Atrian teens will enroll in a suburban human high school, with the goal of testing the feasibility of human/alien integration. The eyes of the nation and the whole world are fixed on this historical social experiment, an endeavor fraught with suspicion and fear. In the mayhem of the first day, Emery is amazed to learn that Roman was not killed by the authorities and is, in fact, one of the Atrian students. Their childhood bond is quickly rekindled - in a school and a society that distrusts everything about the Atrians, Emery and Roman have found each other again. However, their relationship is threatened by the small-mindedness of their respective communities and the political agendas of people in power. While the world around them rages with anger and prejudice, their bond becomes increasingly strong and increasingly dangerous. As an epic Romeo and Juliet romance unfolds, a violent encounter between Roman's father and Emery's father occurs in the Sector. Can Roman and Emery's love - and peace between the species - survive?</p>","updated":1532354048,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/189"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/13125"}}},{"id":190,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/190/crisis","name":"Crisis","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Action","Thriller"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2014-03-16","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":7.4},"weight":95,"network":{"id":1,"name":"NBC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":35791,"thetvdb":269592,"imdb":"tt2322158"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/1/2786.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/1/2786.jpg"},"summary":"<p>It's field trip day for the students of Ballard High School, a place that educates the children of Washington, D.C.'s elite, top-of-their-industry CEOs, international diplomats, political power players and even the president's son.

Quintus Lentulus Batiatus becomes a lanista (manager) when he takes over his father's ludus of gladiators. He has ambitions of stepping out of his father's shadow by seeking recognition for his own name and achieving further greatness for his house. By his side stands his beautiful wife Lucretia who will help her husband achieve his ambitions, whatever the cost. Batiatus puts all his fortunes on the man who will gain him fame and glory. That would be his best gladiator, the Celt, Gannicus, a skilled warrior who wields dual swords with deadly purpose. Those who oppose Batiatus and his future champion(s) of Capua do so at their own peril.</p><p>Purchased as an undisciplined and disheveled recruit in the first episode, Crixus the Gaul endures mockery and threats of death to become the champion after Gannicus. As Batiatus fends off repeated attempts by his professional rival Tullius to obtain Gannicus, his relationships with his father Titus and friend Solonius begin to suffer the strain of his relentless ambition. Former champion, Oenomaus, reluctantly becomes Doctore, while Syrian recruits Ashur and Dagan try to prove themselves worthy of being gladiators. Veteran gladiators Barca and Gannicus note the rising star of Crixus, as the machinations of Batiatus and Lucretia end in tragedy for several members of the household. Against all of this, the city's splendid new arena nears completion and with it the opening games that will make slaves into gods. When the arena opens, Batiatus' gladiators prevail in the contest. Gannicus again proves himself to be the champion of Capua and a god of the arena. By virtue of his win against Solonius' gladiators, he gains his freedom and Crixus becomes the new champion.</p>","updated":1524239520,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/358"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/33090"}}},{"id":360,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/360/ripper-street","name":"Ripper Street","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Crime","Mystery"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2012-12-30","officialSite":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03fvc1c","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Monday"]},"rating":{"average":8.7},"weight":76,"network":{"id":37,"name":"BBC Two","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","timezone":"Europe/London"}},"webChannel":{"id":3,"name":"Amazon Prime","country":null},"externals":{"tvrage":32451,"thetvdb":260485,"imdb":"tt2183641"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/2/5461.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/2/5461.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The Whitechapel police fight to bring law to the lawless in the wake of Jack the Ripper's reign of terror.</p>","updated":1526764294,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/360"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/960715"}}},{"id":361,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/361/saturday-night-live","name":"Saturday Night Live","type":"Variety","language":"English","genres":["Comedy","Music"],"status":"Running","runtime":90,"premiered":"1975-10-11","officialSite":"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live","schedule":{"time":"23:29","days":["Saturday"]},"rating":{"average":7.2},"weight":95,"network":{"id":1,"name":"NBC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":5098,"thetvdb":76177,"imdb":"tt0072562"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/2/5468.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/2/5468.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Saturday Night Live</b> is an Emmy Award-winning late-night comedy showcase.</p><p>Since its inception in 1975, \"SNL\" has launched the careers of many of the brightest comedy performers of their generation.

Out of this chaos emerges a new hero: Jane Vasco, a.k.a. Painkiller Jane. Once the DEA's top agent, Jane Vasco is formidable, both mentally and physically. As a child, her father nicknamed her Painkiller Jane, describing her ability to mentally push through even the most painful situations. But her strength is about to be tested. Jane is recruited by a covert government agency dedicated to containing and, if necessary, neutralizing the threat of \"Neuros\" — individuals with superhuman neurological powers. No one knows what caused the aberrations that led to their enhanced abilities, which range from from telekinesis and telepathic suggestion to induced hallucinations. During her first investigation with her new team, Jane discovers that she too possesses an odd ability: she can't be killed. Unfortunately, she can still feel pain. Her newfound powers make Jane even more determined to learn everything there is to know about Neuros. Seldom malicious, Neuros often can't control their powers. Consequently, they tend to leave a trail of death and destruction. To prevent a panic, the government has kept the discovery of Neuros a secret, assembling a covert unit to identify and contain Neuros. Operating from a secure abandoned subway platform, the core members of the unit are Andre McBride, the seasoned team leader; Connor King, a special agent regularly armed with a smart remark; Riley Jensen, an evolved computer whiz in charge of surveillance and communications; Dr. Seth Carpenter, the unit's doctor and scientist; Joe Waterman, the middle-aged caretaker of the subway; and Maureen Bowers, Jane's former DEA partner and friend, who, like Jane, was recruited after discovering top-secret information about Neuros. Painkiller Jane is based on the comic-book series of the same name created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Joe Quesada.</p>","updated":1504827438,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/484"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/43815"}}},{"id":485,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/485/day-break","name":"Day Break","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Science-Fiction","Thriller"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2006-11-15","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Wednesday"]},"rating":{"average":8.5},"weight":91,"network":{"id":3,"name":"ABC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":8152,"thetvdb":79509,"imdb":"tt0801425"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/3/9395.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/3/9395.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Detective Brett Hopper is having a hellacious day; the kind of day where nothing goes his way and he just cant wait to put it behind him... only he cant, because hes living the same day over and over again.</p>","updated":1523125042,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/485"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/43829"}}},{"id":486,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/486/andromeda","name":"Andromeda","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Action","Science-Fiction"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2000-10-02","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"19:00","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":7.4},"weight":57,"network":{"id":16,"name":"Syfy","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":2608,"thetvdb":77544,"imdb":"tt0213327"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/3/9402.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/3/9402.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Dylan Hunt is the courageous captain of the most glorious starship in the universe, the <b>Andromeda</b> Ascendant.

But after the tragic (and still unsolved) murder of his wife Trudy, Monk developed an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Now consumed by peculiar obsessions and wracked with hundreds of phobias (including but certainly not limited to germs, heights, and even milk), Monk has lost his badge and struggles with even the simplest everyday tasks. Despite his many quirks, Monk is fortunate to have some supportive friends. With the help of his gifted therapist Dr. Kroger, Monk has made some gradual progress in controlling his condition. Monk's first personal assistant, Sharona Fleming, was able to help him pick up the pieces of his life and get back to doing what he does best: solving crimes. Though Monk was devastated when she moved away, he soon found hope in the form of a spunky new assistant, Natalie Teeger, whose unique brand of tough love proved to be just what Monk needed. In Natalie, Monk has found more than just an assistant; she's a faithful friend, a savvy businesswoman, and, it turns out, a pretty good assistant detective to boot. Natalie and her teenage daughter Julie have welcomed Monk into their family. And though Natalie and Monk have grown close, she's never afraid to give her boss a loving kick in the pants when he needs it. Now working as a private consultant, Monk continues to investigate cases in the most unconventional ways. Although Monk is no longer a member of the police force, his former boss Captain Leland Stottlemeyer still often calls upon him to provide unique insights into cases that have the cops stumped. Stottlemeyer himself is a highly decorated detective, but he knows he will never be as good as the illustrious Monk... and it drives him crazy. Still, he's a loyal friend to Monk, as is Lieutenant Randall Disher the Captain's self-appointed go-to guy, a cop with enough eagerness to almost make up for his lack of brilliance as a detective. Monk is a detective afraid of the dark, a gumshoe afraid of gum. He has no problem cracking a case - as long as it doesn't involve heights or germs, and is in close proximity to his apartment. Other than solving his wife's murder, Monk would like nothing more than to gain back his position on the San Francisco police force, but can he pull himself together and get back to solving crimes full time?</p>","updated":1523826972,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/543"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/49977"}}},{"id":544,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/544/home-improvement","name":"Home Improvement","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy","Family"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"1991-09-17","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"20:00","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":7.6},"weight":72,"network":{"id":3,"name":"ABC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":3887,"thetvdb":77537,"imdb":"tt0101120"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/4/11457.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/4/11457.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The universal themes of family, parenting, the battle of the sexes -- and of course, man's need for \"more power\" -- come to play each and every weekday on <b>Home Improvement</b>.

Prior to the development of warp engines that could reach a velocity of warp 5, missions of this nature were impossible. At warp 2, only a handful of inhabited planets were within a year's travel from Earth. But at warp 5, that number increases to ten thousand planets!

As the boys began to dig, they found a number of intriguing artifacts. It was the end of the piracy era and rumors of buried treasure were rampant. The boys' discovery launched a treasure hunt that has spanned more than 200 years, cost millions of dollars and involved dozens of speculators, engineers and even famous personalities such as John Wayne, Errol Flynn and Franklin D. Roosevelt. It has also cost six men their lives. According to legend, a seventh must die before the mystery will be solved in <b>The Curse of Oak Island</b>.

Sydney Andrews is the landlady, still beautiful at 40, and a central figure in the lives of all her tenants, especially handsome and rebellious David Breck. Sydney started an affair with David despite her turbulent history with his estranged father, Dr. Michael Mancini. Both father and son learned through experience that Sydney was not above using blackmail to control people. Another tenant, high-powered publicist Ella Simms, once considered Sydney her mentor, but their friendship was destroyed by betrayal, and Sydney threatened to evict Ella and ruin her career. Sydney also played a pivotal role in the career of Auggie Kirkpatrick. After they met at an AA meeting, she became Auggie's sponsor and encouraged his dream to become a chef. Now a successful sous chef at the trendy restaurant Coal, Auggie has been avoiding Sydney since she began drinking again. The other tenants include Lauren Yung, a medical student in desperate need of money to pay her student loans, and Jonah Miller, an aspiring filmmaker who has just proposed to his live-in girlfriend Riley Richmond, a first-grade teacher. The newest tenant, 18-year-old Violet Foster, has just arrived in LA with her own secret connection to Sydney. When a bloody body is found floating in the courtyard pool, David is the leading suspect.

But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience.</p><p>This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him.</p><p>Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner Cell Block H, Wentworth Prison is, at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels are forced to forge unlikely friendships and allegiances if they want to survive their time inside.</p>","updated":1532602783,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1828"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1495058"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1498937"}}},{"id":1833,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1833/banished","name":"Banished","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Crime"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2015-03-05","officialSite":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02jfvpn","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Thursday"]},"rating":{"average":8.2},"weight":74,"network":{"id":37,"name":"BBC Two","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","timezone":"Europe/London"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":47763,"thetvdb":292323,"imdb":"tt3508050"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/80/201739.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/80/201739.jpg"},"summary":"<p>At its heart, <b>Banished</b> is a story of survival.

But why should he - he's rich! The son of an oil tycoon, Steve hasn't had to work a day in his life and has always gotten everything he's wanted - with one exception: the love of Emmy. The daughter of a former Wilde housekeeper, Emmy is an earnest do-gooder who has spent her adult life trying to save the world. And though Emmy is content living with an indigenous tribe in the Amazon rainforest, her 12-year-old daughter, Puddle, just wants to be a normal kid experiencing her adolescence in a normal place. And she would speak up except for the fact that she hasn't spoken in years. When Wilde Oil's expansion in the rain forest threatens her adopted tribe, Emmy decides to attend Steve's self-thrown \"Humanitarian of the Year\" award ceremony in hopes of convincing him to help her cause...and also maybe because she still has a thing for Steve. But same-old Steve is unwilling to help because fighting Wilde Oil (a/k/a Dad) means putting his meal ticket in jeopardy. Rather than run the risk of letting Emmy slip away again, Steve pulls out all the stops to win her heart. To do so, he enlists the only other people in his life who can help: Migo Salazar, Steve's employee/sidekick/errand-boy, and Gertie Stellvertretter, Steve's nanny-turned-head-of-security as well as the biggest protector of Steve...and her own job. Despite having everything he ever wanted, Steve knows he can't buy love and happiness, which falls in sharp contrast to Emmy, who has nothing but love and happiness. So with Emmy committed to doing good for nothing, and Steve being a good for nothing, will this hopelessly mismatched pair ever be able to reconcile their differences?</p>","updated":1525813628,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/2007"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/161650"}}},{"id":2008,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/2008/skins","name":"Skins","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Romance"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2011-01-17","officialSite":"http://www.mtv.com/shows/skins","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Monday"]},"rating":{"average":5.3},"weight":74,"network":{"id":22,"name":"MTV","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":25843,"thetvdb":174991,"imdb":"tt1755893"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/11/28126.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/11/28126.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Skins</b> is about the lives and loves of teenagers and the obligations of friendship.

Kim and Louie's best friends are Mike and Tina, a married couple with an enviably simple life (Mike brings home the bacon, Tina in turn has sex with him) and a bunch of kids from their current and previous marriages. Across the hall are an African-American couple, Walter and Ellen, and their daughter Lisa, a family with whom Louie awkwardly tries to cultivate a friendship. Also living in the building is Kim's eccentric brother Jerry, who has a blurry past and is in constant need of direction (and food). There's also Louie's friend Rich, who lives with his mother and earns a living through shady means.

Created by Pen Densham, \"Space Rangers\" is a compelling story about a group of adventurers for whom no task is too great. This six part miniseries features an ongoing cast of rugged, likeable peacekeepers who must do battle against a new set of obstacles in each of six closed-end episodes. The year is 2104. Explorers have stretched civilization to the farthest reaches of the galaxy establishing remote outposts. They've discovered new worlds and learned to share them with new races. A few elite men and women have volunteered to go to the frontier, not to rule, but to uphold the law. These are the \"Space Rangers\", part Peacekeepers, part Marines. Much like the pioneers or cavalry before them, who tamed the Wild West, the \"Space Rangers\" have left behind their old, comfortable life to seek new frontiers and challenges. With this quest come new enemies as well. None are as fierce as the \"Banshies\", who are akin to the Apaches to those who were trying to colonize the Old West. These brutal warriors are the greatest fear and impediment in the galaxy. While \"Space Rangers\" deals with life on the frontier, the program also addresses our current problems in a futuristic setting. Topics such as honor, responsibility or losing one's job to automation underscore the adventurous elements in each episode. This sense of morality or \"message\" is subtely interspliced into each episode, taking \"Space Rangers\" one step beyond the average sci-fi show.</p>","updated":1528545169,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/3740"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/240314"}}},{"id":3741,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/3741/hill-street-blues","name":"Hill Street Blues","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"1981-01-15","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Tuesday","Thursday"]},"rating":{"average":8.4},"weight":72,"network":{"id":1,"name":"NBC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":3865,"thetvdb":74449,"imdb":"tt0081873"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/19/47756.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/19/47756.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The lives and work of the staff of an inner city police precinct.</p>","updated":1532303389,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/3741"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/240461"}}},{"id":3743,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/3743/welcome-back-kotter","name":"Welcome Back, Kotter","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"1975-09-23","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":6},"weight":61,"network":{"id":3,"name":"ABC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":78572,"imdb":"tt0072582"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/19/47757.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/19/47757.jpg"},"summary":"<p>A compassionate teacher returns to his inner city high school of his youth to teach a new generation of trouble making kids.</p>","updated":1528247686,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/3743"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/240588"}}},{"id":3746,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/3746/beauty-and-the-beast","name":"Beauty and the Beast","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Crime","Fantasy"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"1987-09-25","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":6.6},"weight":61,"network":{"id":2,"name":"CBS","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":2744,"thetvdb":75004,"imdb":"tt0092319"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/19/47760.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/19/47760.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Beauty and the Beast</b> is a story that tells just how powerful love is.

Seeing as there was no stopping him, MTV decided to give him his own show, <b>Viva La Bam</b>, where he spent five seasons playfully tormenting his ever-patient parents, April (aka Ape) and Phil, with his outrageous antics. What was Bam able to get away with? Whatever the @#!% he wanted! Margera and his CKY crew -- Ryan Dunn, Brandon DiCamillo, Raab Himself and Rake Yohn -- played every practical joke imaginable on Bam's family, always with hilarious results. Viva La Bam usually revolved around destroying Ape and Phil's home and forcing family members to compete for \"prizes.\" From outrageous scavenger hunts to converting the family home into a skate park to loading elephants onto the front lawn, Bam and his clan always managed to up the ante and push his parents' sanity to the limits. Each episode of Viva La Bam revolved around a challenge, mission or theme that would be completed through a series of stunts involving Bam's friends and family. Bearing the brunt of physical abuse was Bam's uncle Don Vito, who was often duct taped to chairs, held down as motorcycles jumped over his head or forced to complete a \"slobstacle course.\" Season 1 of Viva La Bam ended with Ape and Phil's house being \"blown up,\" and the family was forced to move because the neighbors had had enough of the Margeras' antics. But moving the family to a bigger house in a quieter neighborhood during season 2 only encouraged Bam and his CKY crew to try even crazier stunts, including holding a demolition derby in the backyard. By season 4 of Viva La Bam, Bam and his clan had caused so much trouble in their new neighborhood that Ape and Phil dragged them across the Atlantic, where they pranked their way through Europe. Guests that appeared on Viva La Bam included rockers like HIM, the Bloodhound Gang, Hanoi Rocks, Gwar and Billy Idol, as well as freestyle motocross team Metal Mulisha and skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. Although Viva La Bam ended in 2005, Bam continued his wild ways on Bam's Unholy Union. This time around, though, Bam played his over-the-top tricks on his fiancée, Missy, while she struggled to plan their wedding. During Viva La Bam's five seasons, Bam proudly put Ape, Phil and Don Vito through more hell than anyone could have ever imagined -- probably even Bam himself...</p>","updated":1503294307,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/3943"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/252915"}}},{"id":3945,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/3945/angie-tribeca","name":"Angie Tribeca","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy","Crime"],"status":"Running","runtime":30,"premiered":"2016-01-17","officialSite":"http://www.tbs.com/shows/angie-tribeca.html","schedule":{"time":"22:30","days":["Monday"]},"rating":{"average":6.9},"weight":95,"network":{"id":32,"name":"TBS","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":38778,"thetvdb":281614,"imdb":"tt3597790"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/137/342740.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/137/342740.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Lone-wolf detective Angie Tribeca and a squad of committed LAPD detectives investigate the most serious cases, from the murder of a ventriloquist to a rash of baker suicides.</p>","updated":1524844554,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/3945"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1156184"}}},{"id":3946,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/3946/bordertown","name":"Bordertown","type":"Animation","language":"English","genres":["Comedy"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"2016-01-03","officialSite":"http://www.fox.com/bordertown","schedule":{"time":"19:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":6.4},"weight":62,"network":{"id":4,"name":"FOX","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":38830,"thetvdb":275120,"imdb":"tt3323254"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/82/205525.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/82/205525.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Bordertown</b> centers on two clans: the Buckwalds and the Gonzalezes.

His co-workers include Dr. Miranda Foster, a surgical fellow with a rebellious streak and fiery temper who strives to live up to her deceased father's excellent surgical reputation; Dr. David Lee, a womanizing surgical resident who has broken as many hearts as he has replaced; Ryan Abbott, the inexperienced new transplant coordinator who arranges the intricately choreographed process of quickly and carefully transporting organs from donor to patient; Dr. Sophia Jordan, a brilliant surgeon at the top of her field and the head of surgery for the hospital, who has trained throughout the world, which gives her an extremely diverse point of view; Pam Acosta, Andy's no-nonsense operating assistant and best friend; and Dr. Lisa Reed, an E.R. doctor who is haunted by her past and compensates by doing everything she can to spare her patients from the pain she experienced at an early age.

The two girls were as different as night and day: Laverne was feisty, quick-tempered and man-hungry while Shirley was more naive and trusting and quite inexperienced when it came to romance. The two shared their apartment building with Leonard \"Lenny\" Kosnowski and Andrew \"Squiggy\" Squigman, two wannabe greasers who always visited at the most inconvenient times and drove the girls insane.

But underneath the surface, these beautiful landscapes reveal a much more sinister reality – a dumping ground for bodies and a home to countless unsolved murders. On Tuesday, January 5 at 10 PM ET/PT, Discovery Channel will premiere its first-ever true crime series titled <b>Killing Fields</b> and take viewers inside an active criminal investigation as it unfolds. Shot in real time, the series follows the hunt for the killer.</p><p><i>Killing Fields</i> will go inside a case that went cold nearly two decades ago in the small community of Iberville Parish, Louisiana, located just 15 miles from the state capitol, Baton Rouge. In June 1997, Louisiana State University graduate student Eugenie Boisfontaine was last seen near LSU's lakes. Two months later, her body was found nearby in a watery ditch with evidence of blunt force trauma to her head. But who did it and why? Was it a single act of violence? Or was her murder part of a much bigger string of killings? Between 1997 and 2003, there were 60 cases of missing and murdered women in the area that went unsolved. And to make it even more complicated, the Baton Rouge area had multiple serial killers operating at the same time with two of the their victims living on the same street as Eugenie. Could these murders be connected?</p><p>Detective Rodie Sanchez was assigned to the case in 1997 and hasn't stopped thinking about it since. He makes the bold decision to come out of retirement and gets permission to re-open the case. Rodie is determined to solve the mystery and make good on a broken promise to Eugenie's mother: to find the person (or persons) responsible for killing her daughter. \"You never forget your first murder or crime scene,\" Rodie said. \"Once that gets in your blood, you want to be a cop for the rest of your life. I had a good life in law enforcement for over 30 some years. I missed it and thought about [this case] every day.\"</p><p>Joining Rodie in the chase is a young hot-shot detective, Aubrey St. Angelo, who has a knack for reading people and isn't afraid to ask the tough questions. However, the two can't solve this case alone – they are joined by top-notch detectives at the Iberville Parish Sheriff's office. With advancements in forensic science and DNA analysis, a lot has changed since 1997. But will this be enough to crack the case for good? And will Rodie be able to finally rest and move beyond the case that has forever haunted him?</p>","updated":1518682394,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/10029"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1398009"}}},{"id":10061,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/10061/dark-net","name":"Dark Net","type":"Documentary","language":"English","genres":["Crime"],"status":"Running","runtime":30,"premiered":"2016-01-21","officialSite":"http://www.sho.com/sho/dark-net/home","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Thursday"]},"rating":{"average":6.1},"weight":90,"network":{"id":9,"name":"Showtime","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":50778,"thetvdb":303598,"imdb":"tt5397520"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/34/85968.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/34/85968.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Advancements in technology have made it possible for us to connect in the most astonishing ways.

It's harder. Inspired by true events, <b>APB</b> is a new police drama with a high-tech twist. Sky-high crime, officer-involved shootings, cover-ups and corruption: the over-extended and under-funded Chicago Police Department is spiraling out of control. Enter billionaire engineer Gideon Reeves. After his best friend is murdered in a botched attempted robbery, and the killer remains at large, Gideon demands justice. Putting up millions of dollars of his own money, he makes an unprecedented deal to take over the troubled 13th District - and reboot it as a private police force: better, faster and smarter than anything seen before. With cutting-edge technology created by Gideon himself, this eccentric yet brilliant outsider challenges the city's police force to rethink everything about the way they fight crime. But the near-overnight transition to the city's most advanced police district doesn't sit well with all of its members. Gideon knows if he's going to change anything, he needs an ally, whom he finds in Officer Theresa Murphy, an ambitious, street-smart cop who is ready to embrace Gideon's technological changes. With the help of Gideon's gifted tech officer, Ada Hamilton, he and Murphy embark on a mission to turn the 13th District - including a skeptical Sgt. Ned Conrad, and determined Officers Nicholas Brandt and Tasha Goss - into a dedicated crime-fighting force of the 21st century.</p>","updated":1520878476,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/12336"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1039347"}}},{"id":12341,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/12341/gaycation","name":"Gaycation","type":"Documentary","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Romance"],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"premiered":"2016-02-29","officialSite":"https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/gaycation","schedule":{"time":"22:30","days":["Wednesday"]},"rating":{"average":9},"weight":90,"network":{"id":1006,"name":"Viceland","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":306647,"imdb":"tt5430288"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/73/182741.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/73/182741.jpg"},"summary":"<p>On <b>Gaycation</b>, Ellen Page and her best friend, Ian Daniel, set off on a personal journey to explore LGBTQ cultures around the world.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd 9-year-old brother. Finally, there's Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, who sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. For 10 years on THE BIG BANG THEORY, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy gives us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","updated":1532343429,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/26020"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1430929"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1473827"}}},{"id":26082,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/26082/pose","name":"Pose","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama"],"status":"Running","runtime":60,"premiered":"2018-06-03","officialSite":null,"schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":7.3},"weight":99,"network":{"id":13,"name":"FX","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":346026,"imdb":"tt7562112"},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/154/387304.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/154/387304.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Set in 1986, <b>Pose</b> examines the juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in New York City: the emergence of the luxury Trump-era universe, the downtown social and literary scene and the ball culture world.</p>","updated":1532529785,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/26082"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/1476722"}}},{"id":26088,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/26088/extinct","name":"Extinct","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Science-Fiction","Thriller"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2017-10-01","officialSite":"https://extinct.tv","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":6.4},"weight":95,"network":null,"webChannel":{"id":223,"name":"BYUtv","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"externals":{"tvrage":null,"thetvdb":326918,"imdb":null},"image":{"medium":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/124/312238.jpg","original":"http://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/124/312238.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Extinct</b> takes place 400 years after the extinction of the human race and follows a small group of humans who are revived by an alien civilization.
